"""
A module to create human-looking interactions with the hearthstone client.

Some ideas:
- Create a thread class to execute our smokescreens:
  - This can be used when performing computing intensive tasks.
  - When waiting for our turn
  - When waiting for animation to complete from minion attacks
- Create a function that hovers over cards in hand. 
- Create a function for hovering over minions
- Create a function for emoting
- Create a function that sleeps for a random short interval after clicking,
  as if thinking about an action.
- Create a function that picks a card and hovers over play area,
  but doesn't actually play it. Can call this randomly when playing minions.
- Create a function to hover over history.
- Play with the environment every now and then.

Control -- Add salt to all operations

Future:
- When tingle can play cards with targeting, fake playing them and cancelling their play.
